      <div class="optimization_text">
        On the vast expanses of the internet, there are countless active and even abandoned websites. Most of them not
        only
        belong to the same categories but also have similar content.
        <br><br>
        Imagine thousands of websites that, in one way or another, provide the same information or offer the same
        services. You
        can only find these websites through thematic queries in search engines.
        <br><br>
        But what do you do if your website is similar to hundreds or thousands of others, and there are only 10
        positions on the
        first page of Google or Yandex? How do you attract visitors to your site? This is where optimization comes into
        play â€“
        to get your website to appear on the first page of search results!
        <br><br>
        <span>will teach you how to make your site attractive to search engines and advise you on how to get it to the top
        pages,
        surpassing all competitors.</span>
